        <!-- <h1>Why Do Mothers Stop Breastfeeding Early?</h1> -->
        <h1>What CDC -Centers for Disease Control and Prevention- Is Doing To Support Breastfeeding?</h1>

       
        <h2>Collecting data to learn how best to improve breastfeeding rates in the United States. </h2>
        <p>
            By tracking how long infants are breastfed, 
            and calculate breastfeeding indicators by year of child birth.
            <br />
            For each birth year, they estimate the percentage of infants in the following categories: <br>“ever breastfed,” “breastfed at 6 months,” “breastfed at 12 months,” “exclusively breastfed through 3 months,” and “exclusively breastfed through 6 months.” whose mothers started breastfeeding.
        <br/>Ever breastfed” is estimated by the question: “Was [child] ever breastfed or fed breast milk?”
    <br/>“Breastfeeding duration” is estimated by the question: “How old was [child] when he/she completely stopped breastfeeding or being fed breast milk?”
      <br>
      also calculate the percentage of breastfed infants who are supplemented with infant formula before they are 2 days, 3 months, and 6 months old. The rates of formula supplementation (with or without other supplementary liquids or solids) before 2 days, 3 months, and 6 months are calculated among infants who are breastfeeding at each respective age, whereas the breastfeeding initiation, duration, and exclusivity rates are calculated among all infants surveyed.
      <br><br>
      Among infants born in 2019, 
      most (83.2%) started out receiving some breast milk, and 78.6% were receiving any breast milk at 1 month. At 6 months, 55.8% of infants received any breast milk and 24.9% received breast milk exclusively. Families can face many challenges when it comes to breastfeeding. Yet data show that most infants start out breastfeeding, and many are still receiving some breast milk at 6 months. Even some breast milk is beneficial to infants.
       However, many families do not breastfeed for as long as they intend to and breastfeeding disparities by race and ethnicity persist. The steady decline in any and exclusive breastfeeding from month-to-month indicates that breastfeeding families may need stronger systems 
      of support to reach their breastfeeding goals.
