    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Breastfeeding has many health benefits for infants, 
        children, and mothers and is a key strategy 
        to improve public health. The 2020–2025 
        Dietary Guidelines for Americans  and the 
        American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that
         infants be exclusively breastfed for about the 
         first 6 months, with continued breastfeeding alongside the introduction of complementary foods for at least 1 year (Dietary Guidelines) or at least 2 years (AAP), or longer if desired. CDC’s Breastfeeding Report Card, 2022 provides a compilation of data on breastfeeding practices and supports 
        in all states, the District of Columbia, 
        and Puerto Rico.</p>
