    <h1>Breast Milk Is Best</h1>

   
    <p>Breastfeeding and human milk are the normative standards for infant feeding and nutrition. The short- and long-term medical and neurodevelopmental advantages of breastfeeding make breastfeeding, or the provision of human milk, a public health imperative. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends exclusive 
        breastfeeding for approximately 6 months after birth.</p>
    <P> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and The Joint Commission monitor breastfeeding practices in US hospitals. Pediatricians play a critical role in hospitals, their practices, and communities as advocates of breastfeeding and, thus, need to be trained about the benefits of breastfeeding for mothers and children and in managing breastfeeding.</P>

        <h2>Breastfeeding is the best 
            source of nutrition for 
            most infants. </br>
            It can also reduce the risk for certain health conditions for both infants and mothers.</h2>
        
        <p>Infants who are breastfed have reduced risks of for example Asthma, Obisity, Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
        </br>Breastfeeding can help lower a motherâ€™s risk of for example Breast cancer, Type 2 diabetes, and Hypertension.
