        <h1>Why Do Mothers Stop Breastfeeding Early?</h1>
            <h2>Sixty percent of mothers do not breastfeed for as long as they intend to. 
            </h2>
            <p>How long a mother breastfeeds her baby (duration) is influenced by many factors including:</p>
                
            </br>
            Nutritional, Psychosocial, Lactational, Medical, and Lifestyle Factors.

            <p>
        This study highlights factors associated with the reasons why women stop breastfeeding completely before six months and how these reasons varied with weaning age. The results will help inform future research aimed at identifying interventions to reduce early breastfeeding cessation.
